I have accepted the task of being a lead analyst on a video game. I have detailed my findings in the file marked Heros fo Pymoli.
My Analysis states that there are currently a majority of males players, though it seems that is there a trend to more female players joining. I can also see that more people are buying the higher rank items, most likely they are hitting the level cap for the game. The age range of the game is increasing as well, the young players that found this game are growing up while still playing.
